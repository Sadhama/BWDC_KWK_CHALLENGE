# BWDC_KWK_CHALLENGE
This is the code sample shows the code that I used in order to extract data out of Yelp API. I was struggling at first but I realised it was quite simple later on. I am quite new to github, the interface and essentially what this entire platform is for, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes or errors I make on this platform!

Sadhana Gangadharan for the KWK BWDC challenge.
