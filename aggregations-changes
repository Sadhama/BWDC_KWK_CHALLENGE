# I just needed to get rid of the null values in the datasets,I not only did this for the black owned businesses tulsa dataset, but also the other datasets I collected from the BWDC.

import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('black_owned_businesses_tulsa.csv')

# Drop rows with null values
df = df.dropna()

# Drop columns with all zeros
df = df.loc[:, (df != 0).any(axis=0)]

# Display the cleaned dataset
print(df)
